## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-planning]: Use native pgx/v5 (not sqlx); use goose v3 (not golang-migrate) — per STACK.md authority over ARCHITECTURE.md comments
- [Pre-planning]: bluemonday is a required dependency (security-critical); must be added before Phase 1 implementation starts
- [Pre-planning]: HTMX vs vanilla JS for split-pane preview is an open question — decide during Phase 3 planning
- [Pre-planning]: Postgres sessions table migration must exist before Phase 3 (admin) work begins
- [Phase 01-foundation]: goldmark → bluemonday pipeline order locked; html.WithUnsafe() safe only with bluemonday downstream
- [Phase 01-foundation]: module name: github.com/jared-wallace/website-go

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 6 (Docker): Postgres EBS bind-mount requires `chown 999:999` on host before first run — document in Makefile deploy target (Pitfall 3)
- Phase 6 (Docker): ASG must have `max_size = 1` and `delete_on_termination = false` before any production data is written (Pitfall 8)
- Phase 3 (Admin): Go 1.26 stdlib may include CrossOriginProtection — confirm before reaching for gorilla/csrf during Phase 3 planning
